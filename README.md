# Redis Overview
Redis is a well-known, open-source key-value store used in web services. It functions as a cache, message broker, and database. Its popularity stems from its speed, wide range of client libraries, and extensive use in enterprise settings.

# Redis Modules
Redis extends its capabilities through Redis Modules. These modules add new data types and commands, enhancing Redis's functionality. Notable examples include RedisJSON for JSON data management, RedisTimeSeries for time series data, RedisBloom for probabilistic data structures, and RediSearch.

# RediSearch Module
RediSearch is a Redis module that enables advanced search capabilities within Redis. It supports querying, secondary indexing, full-text search, and vector search. Users first create indexes on their Redis data, which they can then query efficiently using RediSearch clients. The module is essential for complex search needs in Redis applications.

Redis, traditionally known as a key-value store, has expanded its capabilities to function as a vector database, especially when integrated with the RediSearch module. This integration is particularly valuable in the context of machine learning and AI applications, such as those involving OpenAI embeddings.
